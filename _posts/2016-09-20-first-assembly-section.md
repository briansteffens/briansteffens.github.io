title: First assembly guide section

<p>
    I've started working on some guides to x86-64 assembly language programming
    on Linux. They started as my own personal notes, then started to look a bit
    like a short crash course, then more like proper guides. They target people
    who already have some experience with programming but want to learn a bit
    of assembly. They're heavy on examples and line-by-line explanations, since
    that's the way I learn and explain things best.
</p>

<p>
    I have rough drafts of about 10 or so sections (depending on how the
    content is divided). As sections become ready I'll be publishing them here.
    When/if the entire guide is completed I'll probably combine the sections
    into a single PDF or something like that.

    The table of contents is available
    <a href="/introduction-to-64-bit-assembly/">here</a>.

    If you have comments, suggestions, or corrections, they'd be very welcome.

Making a virtual machine in Google Sheets
=========================================

I recently noticed that Google Docs has a pretty full-featured scripting system
called [Apps Script](https://developers.google.com/apps-script/). It lets you
write JavaScript to do some pretty useful things:

- Run code in response to events like documents opening or cells changing
- Make custom Google Sheets spreadsheet functions for formulas
- Use services like Google Translate to translate text or Gmail to send email
- Add new menu items to the Google Docs interface with your custom features

So naturally I had to do something weird with it. Behold: the Google Sheets
Virtual Machine generating fibonacci numbers!

# How it works

The VM has a memory area of 100 cells, indexed as 0-99. Each cell can contain
an instruction or an integer value.

There's also a stack, which starts at the bottom of the memory area and grows
upward.

Here's how the VM sheet looks when it's empty:

<img src="/blog/google-sheets-virtual-machine/blank.png" />

Notice the following:

- **RA**, **RB**, **RC**, and **RD** are general purpose registers.
- **RI** is the instruction pointer. It points to the next instruction to be
  executed in the memory area, which lights up green.
- **RS** is the stack pointer. It points to the memory cell at the top of the
  stack. This lights up blue.
- **Output** displays the output of a program.
- **Error** displays any errors encountered in parsing or executing an
  instruction.
- **Memory** is a region of 100 cells of memory.

To run an instruction, the Apps Script in the background checks the value
of **RI** to see which instruction to execute next. It reads the instruction
in the cell **RI** is pointing to and parses it.

There are instructions to move data around between memory and registers,
manipulate the stack, or perform conditionals.

After the instruction has been executed, the value of **RI** is
incremented to point to the next cell in memory.





# Usage

There is a custom menu called *Computer* with some functions used to control
the VM:

<img src="/blog/google-sheets-virtual-machine/menu.png" />

- **Run** will run the current program until it ends or an error is
  encountered.
- **Step** runs one instruction and then pauses.
- **Reset** clears all registers and the output field, which makes the program
  ready to run again.
- **Load Factorial Program** loads the factorial example from another sheet.
- **Load Fibonacci Program** loads the fibonacci example from another sheet.





# Instructions

There are a few instructions implemented.

### General

- **mov dst src** copies a value from *src* to *dst*.

### Math

- **add dst src** adds *dst* to *src* and stores the result in *dst*.

- **sub dst src** subtracts *src* from *dst* and stores the result in *dst*.

- **mul dst src** multiplies *dst* by *src* and stores the result in *dst*.

### Stack operations

- **push src** pushes *src* onto the stack.

- **pop dst** pops a value off the top of the stack and stores it in *dst*.

### Jumps and conditionals

- **jmp target** jumps to the instruction in the cell referenced by *target*.

- **jl cmp1 cmp2 target** compares *cmp1* to *cmp2*. If *cmp1* is less than
  *cmp2*, execution jumps to *target*.

### Functions

- **call target** is a function call. It pushes the current instruction pointer
  onto the stack so it can be returned to later, and then jumps to *target*.

- **ret** returns from a function. It pops a value off the stack and jumps to
  it.

### Assorted

- **output src** writes *src* to the *Output:* section of the interface.

- **end** ends the program.




# Addressing modes

The operands in the instructions above can take a few forms:

**Immediates** are literal values embedded into the instruction. Examples are:
`7` and `123`. So to copy the value 7 into the register *ra*:

```
mov ra 7
```

**Registers** refer to registers by name. Examples are: `ra`, `rb`, `rc`. To
copy the value from *rc* into *rb*:

```
mov rb rc
```

**Memory** refers to a value inside a cell of the memory area. Examples are:
`$0`, `$10`, `$99`. To copy the value from *ra* into the first memory cell:

```
mov $0 ra
```

To copy the value from the last memory cell into *rd*:

```
mov rd $99
```

**Indirect** refers to the value a cell of memory is pointing to. Examples are:
`@15`, `@50`. So if memory cell 10 contained the value 20 and memory cell 20
contained the value 30, you could copy the value 30 into *ra* like this:

```
mov ra @10
```

It looks at memory cell 10 to find the value 20. Then it looks at memory cell
20 to find the value 30 and copies that value into *ra*.





# Recursion

You can use the stack and the *call* and *ret* instructions to make recursive
calls. Here's an example which uses recursion to generate the factorial of
the number 5:

<img src="/blog/google-sheets-virtual-machine/factorial.gif" />

The code starting at `jl ra 2 50` is a function which takes an input in *ra*
and returns a result in *rd*. It calls itself recursively to calculate the
factorial of the value in *ra*.




# Getting a copy

If you want to play around with this yourself, you can make a copy of it
[here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1385V2Mu2yZOMSJcSz9JrV6r8X0_JGzHZZRdPhaAdwWY/edit?usp=sharing).

You can see the Apps Script code by going to Tools and then Script Editor.
